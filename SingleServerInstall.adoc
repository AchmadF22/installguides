--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Zimbra Collaboration includes the Zimbra MTA, the Zimbra LDAP
server, and the Zimbra mailbox server. In a single-server installation,
all components are installed on one server and require no additional
manual configuration.

This installation guide is a quick start guide that describes the basic
steps needed to install and configure Zimbra Collaboration in a direct
network connect environment. In this environment, the Zimbra server is
assigned a domain for which it receives mail, and a direct network
connection to the Internet. When Zimbra Collaboration is installed, you
will be able to log on to the Zimbra administration console to manage
the domain and provision accounts. The accounts you create are able to
send and receive external email.

*Important Notice About Single Server Installations*

Zimbra Collaboration is designed to be the only application suite
installed on the server. Zimbra Collaboration bundles and installs, as
part of the installation process various other third party and open
source software, including Apache Jetty, Postfix, and OpenLDAP®. The
versions installed have been tested and configured to work with the
Zimbra software. See the Administrator’s Guide for a complete list of
software.

A Zimbra license is required in order to create accounts on the Zimbra
Collaboration Network Edition. You cannot install Zimbra Collaboration
without a license.

The following table shows the default port settings when Zimbra
Collaboration is installed.

*Zimbra Port Mapping*

|========================

**Important:**You cannot have any other web server, database, LDAP, or
MTA server running, when you install the Zimbra software. If you have
installed any of the applications before you install Zimbra software,
disable these applications. During the Zimbra Collaboration
installation, Zimbra makes global system changes that may break
applications that are on your server.

Zimbra Collaboration runs on one of several operating systems, including
Ubuntu® LTS, Red Hat® Enterprise Linux, and SUSE® Linux Enterprise.

Installation modifications for frequently used operating systems are
described in individual configuration documents found on the Zimbra
Collaboration documentation website. Other operating systems may require
similar modifications, and you can use the information contained in
these documents as a reference to gauge whether your operating system
might need to be modified.

A full default installation of the Linux distribution that you select is
required.

*Note:* Zimbra recommends that the operating systems you use are updated
with the latest patches that have been tested with Zimbra Collaboration.
See the latest release notes to see the operating systems patch list
that has been tested with Zimbra Collaboration.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The high-fidelity document preview feature requires the installation of
LibreOffice or the LibreOffice-headless package, depending on the
operating system you are running.

If the LibreOffice is installed, the system is automatically configured
to use the high-fidelity document preview. If LibreOffice is not
installed, the preview engine from prior Zimbra Collaboration releases
is used.

This can be accomplished with the Linux package management systems:

* For RHEL, install the libreoffice-headless package:

....
yum install libreoffice
yum install libreoffice-headless
....

* For SLES, install libreoffice:

....
yast2 -i libreoffice
....

* For Ubuntu, install libreoffice:

....
apt-get install libreoffice
....

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Confirm you have the appropriate language packs or fonts installed for
LibreOffice to properly view documents and attachments. For example:

* If using Ubuntu 12.04 and viewing East Asian languages, be sure to
install:

....
apt-get install libreoffice-l10n-*
apt-get install ttf-vlgothic
....

* If using Ubuntu 14.04 and viewing East Asian languages, be sure to
install:

....
apt-get install libreoffice-l10n-*
apt-get install fonts-vlgothic
....

* If using RHEL, be sure to install apt-get install:

....

In order to send and receive email, the Zimbra MTA must be configured in
DNS with both A and MX records. For sending mail, the MTA uses DNS to
resolve hostnames and email-routing information. To receive mail, the MX
record must be configured correctly to route the message to the mail
server.

During the installation process, Zimbra Collaboration checks to see if
you have an MX record correctly configured. If it is not, an error is
displayed suggesting that the domain name have an MX record configured
in DNS.

You must configure a relay host if you do not enable DNS. After Zimbra
Collaboration is installed, go to the Global Settings>MTA tab on the
administration console and uncheck Enable DNS lookups. Enter the relay
MTA address to use for external delivery.

 +
**Note:**Even if a relay host is configured, an MX record is still
required if the Zimbra Collaboration server is going to receive email
from the Internet.

Zimbra architecture includes open-source integrations using industry
standard protocols. The third-party software has been tested and
configured to work with the Zimbra software.

The following describes the Zimbra packages that are installed.

* *Zimbra Core:* This package includes the libraries, utilities,
monitoring tools, and basic configuration files. Zimbra Core is
automatically installed on each server.

* *Zimbra Store:* The Zimbra store includes the components for the
mailbox server, including Jetty, which is the servlet container the
Zimbra software runs within. The Zimbra mailbox server includes the
following components:
** Data store: The data store is a MariaDB© database.
** Message store: The message store is where all email messages and file
attachments reside.
** Index store: Index and search technology is provided through Lucene.
Index files are maintained for each mailbox.
** Web application services: The Jetty web application server runs web
applications (webapps) on any store server. It provides one or more web
application services.

* **Zimbra LDAP:**User authentication is provided through OpenLDAP®
software. Each account on the Zimbra server has a unique mailbox ID that
is the primary point of reference to identify the account. The OpenLDAP
schema has been customized for Zimbra Collaboration. The Zimbra LDAP
server must be configured before the other servers. You can set up LDAP
replication, configuring a master LDAP server and replica LDAP servers.

* *Zimbra MTA:* Postfix is the open source mail transfer agent (MTA)
that receives email via SMTP and routes each message to the appropriate
Zimbra mailbox server using Local Mail Transfer Protocol (LMTP). The
Zimbra MTA also includes the anti-virus and anti-spam components.

* *Zimbra Proxy:* Zimbra Proxy is a high-performance reverse proxy
service for passing IMAP[S]/POP[S]/HTTP[S] client requests to other
internal ZCS services.This package is normally installed on the MTA
server(s) or on its own independent server(s). When the zimbra-proxy
package is installed, the proxy feature is enabled by default.
Installing the Zimbra Proxy is highly recommended, and required if using
a separate web application server.

* *Zimbra Memcached:* Memcached is automatically selected when the
zimbra-proxy is installed. At least one server must run zimbra-memcached
when the proxy is in use. You can use a single memcached server with one
or more Zimbra proxies.

* *Zimbra SNMP:* Installing the Zimbra SNMP package is optional. If you
choose to install zimbra-SNMP for monitoring, this package should be
installed on every Zimbra server.

* *Zimbra Logger:* Installing the Zimbra Logger package is optional and
is installed on one mailbox server. The Zimbra Logger installs tools for
syslog aggregation and reporting. If you do not install Logger, the
server statistics section of the administration console will not
display. *Note:* The Logger package must be installed at the same time
as the mailbox server.

* *Zimbra Spell:* Installing the Zimbra Spell package is optional.
Aspell is the open source spell checker used on the Zimbra Web Client.

* *Zimbra Apache:* This package is installed automatically when Zimbra
Spell or Zimbra Convertd is installed.

The Zimbra server configuration is menu driven. The installation menu
shows you the default configuration values. The menu displays the
logical host name and email domain name [mailhost.example.com] as
configured on the computer. You can change any of the values. For single
server installs, you must define the administrator’s password, which you
use to log on to the administration console, and you specify the
location of the Zimbra license xml file.

Collaboration. They include the spam filter accounts for junk mail (spam
and ham), virus quarantine account for email messages with viruses, and
GALsync account if you configure GAL for your domain. Do not delete
these accounts! These accounts do not count against your license.
* Administrator account. Administrator accounts count against your
license.
* User accounts. User accounts count against your license account limit.

When you delete an account, the license account limit reflects the
change.

* Alias account. Aliases do not count against your license.
* Distribution list. Distribution lists do not count against your
license.
* Resource account. Resource accounts (location and resources) do not
count against your ZCS license.

All network edition installations require license activation. New
installations have a 10 day grace period from the license issue date
before requiring activation. Your license can be activated from the
administration console by selecting Configure>Global Settings>License
page, then clicking Activate License in the toolbar. You can also
activate your license from the command line interface.

Upgraded Zimbra Collaboration versions require an immediate activation
to maintain network feature functionality.

If you fail to install or activate your Zimbra Collaboration server
license, the following scenarios describe how your Zimbra Collaboration
server will be impacted.

* License is not installed. If a license is not installed, the Zimbra
Collaboration defaults to single user mode where all features limited by
license are limited to one user.
* License is not valid. If the license file is forged or could not be
validated for other reasons, the Zimbra Collaboration defaults to single
user mode.
* License is not activated. A license activation grace period is 10
days. If for some reason the license is never activated, the Zimbra
Collaboration defaults to single user mode.
* License is in future. If the license starting date is still in the
future, the Zimbra Collaboration defaults to single user mode.
* License is in grace period. If the license ending date has passed and
is within the 30 day grace period, all features limited by license are
still enabled, but administrators may see license renewal prompts.
* License expired. If the license ending date has passed and the 30 day
grace period expired, the Zimbra Collaboration server defaults to the
feature set of the Open Source Edition.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After the Zimbra servers are configured, the following functions must be
configured.

*Important:* Zimbra Collaboration supports the default syslog of a
supported operating system. Depending on your operating system, the
steps contained in this section might not be correct. See your operating
system documentation for specific information about how to enable
syslog.

* If logger is installed, set up the syslog configuration files to
enable server statistics to display on the administration console, and
enable the logger monitor host. The server statistics includes
information about the message count, message volume, and anti-spam and
anti-virus activity.
* Zimbra Collaboration ships a default zimbra user with a disabled
password. Zimbra Collaboration requires access to this account via ssh
public key authentication. On most operating systems this combination is
okay, but if you have modified pam rules to disallow any ssh access to
disabled accounts then you must define a password for the zimbra UNIX
account. This will allow ssh key authentication for checking remote
queues. See the Zimbra wiki article, Mail Queue Monitoring.

*Set up the ssh keys.* To populate the ssh keys, as Zimbra user
(su-zimbra). Type zmupdateauthkeys and press Enter. The key is updated
on /opt/zimbra/.ssh/authorized_keys.

*Enabling Server Statistics Display.* In order for the server statistics
to display on the administration console, the syslog configuration files
must be modified.

\1. As root, type /opt/zimbra/libexec/zmsyslogsetup. This enables the
server to display statistics.

\2. You must enable syslog to log statistics from remote machines.

* Edit the /etc/sysconfig/syslog file, add -r to the SYSLOGD_OPTIONS

setting, SYSLOGD_options=”-r -m 0”

* Stop the syslog daemon. Type /etc/init.d/syslog stop
* Start the syslog daemon. Type /etc/init.d/syslog start

*Note: On DEBIAN AND UBUNTU, step 2 is as follows*

* Edit the /etc/default/syslogd file, add -r to the SYSLOGD_OPTIONS

setting, SYSLOGD_options=”-r -m 0”

* Stop the syslog daemon. Type /etc/init.d/sysklogd stop
* Start the syslog daemon. Type /etc/init.d/sysklogd start

ClamAV detects a virus, it will block attaching the file to the message.
By default, scanning is configured for a single node installation.

Zimbra developed different applications to facilitate moving a user’s
email messages, calendars, and contacts from their old email servers to
their accounts on the Zimbra server. When the user’s files are imported,
the folder hierarchy is maintained. Use one of the Zimbra Collaboration
utilities to move user mail to Zimbra Collaboration to guarantee that
all information is imported correctly.

The following applications can be accessed from the administration
console Download page, and instruction guides are available from the
Help Desk page or from the Zimbra Website, Documentation page.

Alternatively, you can download the following applications from
http://%7Bexample.com/downloads%7D/index.html (with “example” being your
Zimbra server name).

* Zimbra Collaboration Migration Wizard for Exchange. Format is an .exe
file. You can migrate users from Microsoft® Exchange server email
accounts to Zimbra server accounts.
* Zimbra Collaboration Migration Wizard for Domino. Format is an .exe
file. You can migrate users from Lotus Domino server email accounts to
Zimbra server accounts.
* PST Import Wizard (User Instructions). Format is an .exe file. Users
download the Import Wizard to their computers and run the executable
file to import their Outlook .pst files to the Zimbra server. Before
users run this utility, Zimbra recommends that they run the Outlook
Inbox Repair tool, scanpst.exe, on their .pst files, to clean up any
errors in their file. For more information about this tool, go to

* **Postmaster**. The postmaster address is displayed in emails that are
automatically generated from Postfix when messages cannot be sent. If
users reply to this address, the message is forwarded to the admin
mailbox.
* **Root**. This address is where notification messages from the
operating system are sent.

If you entered a notification address for AV alerts when you configured
the MTA, that is different from the default, you need to create that
account in the administration console. If you didn’t change the default
during installation, the anti-virus notification is sent directly to the
admin account.
