configuration options that can be made when you install the {product-name} (ZCS).

Topics in this chapter include:

ïµ Zimbra Application Packages on page 7 ïµ Configuration Examples on page
9 ïµ Downloading the Zimbra Software on page 9 ïµ Zimbra License
Requirements on page 9 ïµ Menu-Driven Configuration on page 12 ïµ Overview

ïµ Configuring for Virtual Hosting on page 25 *Zimbra Application
Packages*

Zimbra architecture includes open-source integrations using industry
standard protocols. The third-party software has been tested and
configured to work with the Zimbra software.

The following describes the Zimbra application packages that are
installed.

ï® **Zimbra Core**. This package includes the libraries, utilities,
monitoring tools, and basic configuration files. Zimbra Core is
automatically installed on each server.

ï® **Zimbra LDAP**. User authentication is provided through OpenLDAPÂ®
software. Each account on the Zimbra server has a unique mailbox ID that
is the primary point of reference to identify the account. The OpenLDAP
schema has been customized for ZCS. The Zimbra LDAP server must be
configured before the other servers. You can set up LDAP replication,
configuring a master LDAP server and replica LDAP servers.

ï® **Zimbra Store**. The Zimbra store includes the components for the
mailbox server, including Jetty, which is the servlet container the
Zimbra software runs within. The Zimbra mailbox server includes the
following components:

â¢ **Data store**. The data store is a MariaDBÂ© database. +
*{product-name} Network Edition 8.6 7*

**Multi-Server Installation Guide +
**â¢ **Message store**. The message store is where all email messages and

ï®

ï®

ï®

ï®

ï®

ï® ï® ï®

ï®

file attachments reside.

â¢ *Index store.* Index and search technology is provided through Lucene.
Index files are maintained for each mailbox.

â¢ **Web application services**. The Jetty web application server runs
web applications (webapps) on any store server. It provides one or more
web application services.

**Zimbra MTA**. Postfix is the open source mail transfer agent (MTA)
that receives email via SMTP and routes each message to the appropriate
Zimbra mailbox server using Local Mail Transfer Protocol (LMTP). The
Zimbra MTA also includes the anti-virus and anti-spam components.

**Zimbra Proxy**. Zimbra Proxy is a high-performance reverse proxy
service for passing IMAP[S]/POP[S]/HTTP[S] client requests to other
internal ZCS services.This package is normally installed on the MTA
server(s) or on its own independent server(s). When the zimbra-proxy
package is installed, the proxy feature is enabled by default.
Installing the Zimbra Proxy is highly recommended, and required if using
a separate web application server.

*Zimbra Memcached.* Memcached is automatically selected when the
zimbra-proxy is installed. At least one server must run zimbra-memcached
when the proxy is in use. You can use a single memcached server with one
or more Zimbra proxies.

**Zimbra SNMP**. Installing the Zimbra SNMP package is optional. If you
choose to install zimbra-SNMP for monitoring, this package should be
installed on every Zimbra server.

**Zimbra Logger**. Installing the Zimbra Logger package is optional and
is installed on one mailbox server. The Zimbra Logger installs tools for
syslog aggregation and reporting. If you do not install Logger, the
server statistics section of the administration console will not
display.

_*Note:*_ _The Logger package must be installed at the same time as the
mailbox server._

**Zimbra Spell**. Installing the Zimbra Spell package is optional.
Aspell is the open source spell checker used on the Zimbra Web Client.

**Zimbra Apache**. This package is installed automatically when Zimbra
Spell or Zimbra Convertd is installed.

**Zimbra Convertd**. Zimbra-convertd package is installed on the zimbra-
store server. Only one Zimbra-convertd package needs to be present in
the {product-name} environment. The default is to install one
zimbra- convertd on each zimbra-store server.

**Zimbra Archiving**. The Zimbra Archiving and Discovery feature is an
optional feature for ZCS Network Edition. Archiving and Discovery offers
the ability to store and search all messages that were delivered to or
sent by ZCS. This package includes the cross mailbox search function
which can be used for both live and archive mailbox searches.

*8 Network Edition 8.6*

*{product-name}*

*Planning for the Installation*

_*Note:*_ _Using Archiving and Discovery can trigger additional mailbox
license usage. To find out more about Zimbra Archiving and Discovery,
contact Zimbra sales._

*Configuration Examples*

ZCS can be easily scaled for any size of email environment, from very
small businesses with fewer than 25 email accounts to large businesses
with thousands of email accounts. Contact Zimbra Sales for more
information about setting up your environment.

*Downloading the Zimbra Software*

**License is not installed**. If a license is not installed, the ZCS
defaults to single user mode where all features limited by license are
limited to one user.

*License is not valid.* If the license file is forged or could not be
validated for other reasons, the ZCS defaults to single user mode.

**License is not activated**. A license activation grace period is 10
days. If for some reason the license is never activated, the ZCS
defaults to single user mode.

**License is in future**. If the license starting date is still in the
future, the ZCS defaults to single user mode.

**License is in grace period**. If the license ending date has passed
and is within the 30 day grace period, all features limited by license
are still enabled, but administrators may see license renewal prompts.

*Planning for the Installation*

*License Activation*

All network edition installations require license activation. New
installations have a 10 day grace period from the license issue date
before requiring activation. Your license can be activated from the
administration console by selecting *Configure>Global Settings>License*
page, then clicking *Activate License* in the toolbar. You can also
activate your license from the command line interface.

Upgraded ZCS versions require an immediate activation of a valid license
to maintain network feature functionality.

*Automatic License Activation*

Licenses are automatically activated if the ZCS server has a connection
to the Internet and can communicate with the Zimbra License server. If
you are unable to automatically activate your license, see the next
section Manual License Activation.

*Manual License Activation*

For systems that do not have external access to the Zimbra License
server, you can use the Zimbra Support Portal to manually activate your
license. Go to the Zimbra website at *www.zimbra.com* and click on the
*Support* page to display the Zimbra Technical Support page. Click on
the *Support Portal Login* button to display the Zimbra Support Portal
page. Enter your email and password to log in.

If you have problems accessing the Support Portal, contact Zimbra Sales
at sales@zimbra.com or by calling 1-650-427-5701.

*License Not Installed or Activated*

If you fail to install or activate your ZCS server license, the
following scenarios describe how your ZCS server will be impacted.

*{product-name}*

*Network Edition 8.6 11*

*Multi-Server Installation Guide*

ï® **License expired**. If the license ending date has passed and the 30
day grace period expired, the ZCS server defaults to the feature set of
the Open Source Edition.

*Obtaining a License*

Go to Zimbraâs Website to obtain a trial license from the Network
Downloads area. Contact Zimbra sales regarding a trial extended license,
or to purchase a subscription license or perpetual license, by emailing
sales@zimbra.com or calling 1-650-427-5701.

The subscription and perpetual license can only be installed on the ZCS
system for which it is purchased. Only one Zimbra license is required
for your {product-name} environment. This license sets the number
of accounts that can be created.

Current license information, including the number of accounts purchased,
the number of accounts used, and the expiration date, can be viewed from
*Configure>Global Settings>License* page on the administration console.

*Menu-Driven Configuration*

The menu driven installation displays the components and their existing
default values. During the installation process you can modify the
default values. Only those menu options associated with the package
being installed are displayed.

Installing the Zimbra-SNMP package is optional. If you choose to install
Zimbra-SNMP for monitoring, the package should be run on every server
(Zimbra server, Zimbra LDAP, Zimbra MTA) that is part of the Zimbra
configuration. Zimbra uses swatch to watch the syslog output to generate
SNMP traps.

When you install zimbra-spell, zimbra-apache gets installed
automatically.

If installed, it is automatically enabled. When composing messages in
the Zimbra Web Client, spell check can be run.

The default is to install one zimbra-convertd on each zimbra-store
server. But only one zimbra-convertd needs to be present in a deployment
depending on size of ZCS environment.

Zimbra Memcached is a separate package from zimbraproxy and is
automatically selected when the zimbra-proxy package is installed. One
server must run zimbramemcached when the proxy is in use. All installed
zimbraproxies can use a single memcached server.

The Zimbra Archiving and Discovery package is an optional feature for
Zimbra Network Edition. Archiving and Discovery offers the ability to
store and search all messages that were delivered to or sent by Zimbra.
This package includes the cross mailbox search function which can be
used for both live and archive mailbox searches.

VMware HA Clustering Heartbeat is only available when running within a
virtual machine running vmware-tools.

This menu lists major new features for the ZCS release and whether
feature are enabled or not. When you change the feature setting during
ZCS installation, you change the default COS settings.

Default is Yes. Sets the schedule for Backup session to run as a full
backup every Sunday at 1 a.m. and as incremental on the other days at 1
a.m.

Start servers after configuration. Save the configuration to file.

*Scanning Attachments in Outgoing Mail*

You can enable real-time scanning of attachments in outgoing emails sent
using the Zimbra Web Client. If enabled, when an attachment is added to
an email, it is scanned using ClamAV prior to sending the message. If
ClamAV detects a virus, it will block attaching the file to the message.
By default, scanning is configured for a single node installation.

To enable in a multi-node environment, one of the MTA nodes needs to be
picked for handling ClamAV scanning. Then enable the following:

zmprov ms <mta server> zimbraClamAVBindAddress <mta server> zmprov mcf
zimbraAttachmentsScanURL clam://<mta server>:3310/ zmprov mcf
zimbraAttachmentsScanEnabled TRUE

*Overview of the Zimbra Proxy Server*

Zimbra Proxy (Nginx-Zimbra) is a high-performance reverse proxy server
that passes IMAP[S]/POP[S]/HTTP[S] client requests to other internal ZCS
services. A reverse proxy server is an Internet-facing server that
protects and manages client connections to your internal services. It
can also provide functions like: GSSAPI authentication, throttle
control, SSL connection with different certificates for different
virtual host names, and other features.

In a typical use case, Zimbra Proxy extracts user login information
(such as account id or user name) and then fetches the route to the
upstream mail server or web serversâ address from âNginx Lookup
Extensionâ, and finally proxy the interactions between clients and
upstream ZCS servers. To accelerate the speed of route lookup, memcached
is introduced, which caches the lookup result. The subsequent login with
the same username is directly proxied without looking up in Nginx Lookup
Extension.

You can install the Zimbra Proxy package on a mailbox server, MTA
server, or on its own independent server. When the Zimbra Proxy package
is installed, the proxy feature is enabled. In most cases, no
modification is necessary.

Benefits for using the Zimbra Proxy include: â¢ Centralizes access to
Mailbox servers

â¢ Load Balancing â¢ Security +
â¢ Authentication +
â¢ SSL Termination â¢ Caching

â¢ Centralized Logging and Auditing â¢ URLRewriting

*Zimbra Proxy Components and Memcached*

Zimbra Proxy is designed to provide a HTTP[S]/POP[S]/IMAP[S] reverse
proxy that is quick, reliable, and scalable. Zimbra Proxy includes the
following:

* 
* 

\1. 2.

3.

4.

5.

End clients connect to Zimbra Proxy using HTTP[S]/POP[S]/IMAP[S] ports.

Proxy attempts to contact a memcached server (elected from the available
memcached servers, using a round-robin algorithm) if available and with
caching enabled to query the upstream route information for this
particular client.

If the route information is present in memcached, then this will be a
cache- hit case and the proxy connects to the corresponding Zimbra
Mailbox server right away and initiates a web/mail proxy session for
this client. The memcached component stores the route information for
the configured period of time (configurable and one hour by default).
Zimbra proxy uses this route information instead of querying the Zimbra
Proxy Route Lookup Handler/NLE until the default period of time has
expired.

If the route information is not present in memcached, then this will be
a cache-miss case, so Zimbra Proxy will proceed sending an HTTP request
to an available Zimbra Proxy Route Lookup Handler/NLE (elected by
round-robin), to look up the upstream mailbox server where this user
account resides.

Zimbra Proxy Route Lookup Handler/NLE locates the route information from
LDAP for the account being accessed and returns this back to Zimbra
Proxy.

*22 Network Edition 8.6*

*{product-name}*

*Planning for the Installation*

\6. Zimbra Proxy uses this route information to connect to the
corresponding Zimbra Mailbox server and initiates a web/mail proxy
session. It also caches this route information into a memcached server
so that the next time this user logs in, the memcached server has the
upstream information available in its cache, and Zimbra Proxy will not
need to contact NLE.The end client is transparent to this and behaves as
if it is connecting directly to the Zimbra Mailbox server.

*Zimbra Proxy Position in ZCS Runtime*

The following figure displays the positions of Zimbra Proxy and its
relationships to other components of ZCS.

*Deployment Strategy*

The deployment strategy and position with respect to non-proxy hosts,
Zimbra actively suggests using the Proxy server on the edge (either on
an independent server or on the same server running LDAP/MTA) with
mailbox servers behind it. In the case of multiple proxies, an external
load balancer can be placed in front to distribute the load evenly among
the proxy servers. Note the Zimbra Proxy package does not act as a
firewall and needs to be behind the firewall in customer deployments.

*Configuration during installation*

zimbra-proxy package needs to be selected during the installation
process (it is installed by default). It is highly recommended to
install memcached as well along with proxy for better performance.

Install zimbra-proxy [Y] Install zimbra-memcached [Y]

This would install and enable all IMAP[S]/POP[S]/HTTP[S] proxy
components with the following default configuration.

*Zimbra Proxy Ports*

The following ports are used either by Zimbra Proxy or by Zimbra Mailbox
(if Proxy is not configured). If you have any other services running on
these ports, turn them off.

End clients connect directly to Zimbra Proxy, using the Zimbra Proxy
Ports. Zimbra Proxy connects to the Route Lookup Handler/NLE (which
resides on Zimbra Mailbox server) using the Zimbra Mailbox Ports.

*Configuring for Virtual Hosting*

You can configure multiple virtual hostnames to host more than one
domain name on a server. When you create a virtual host, users can log
in without have to specify the domain name as part of their user name.

Virtual hosts are configured from the administration console
*Configure>Domains>Virtual Hosts* page. The virtual host requires a
valid DNS configuration with an A record.

When users log in, they enter the virtual host name in the browser. For
example, **https://mail.example.com**. When the Zimbra logon screen
displays, users enter only their user name and password. The
authentication request searches for a domain with that virtual host
name. When the virtual host is found, the authentication is completed
against that domain.

*Preparing Your Server Environment*

In order to successfully install and run {product-name} (ZCS),
ensure your system meets the requirements described in this section.

Topics in this chapter include:

ïµ System Requirements on page 27 +
ïµ Modifying Operating System Configurations on page 27 ïµ Configuring
High-Fidelity Document Preview +
ïµ DNS Configuration Requirement on page 28

_*Important:*_ _Do not manually create the user âzimbraâ before running
the ZCS installation. The installation automatically creates this user
and sets up its environment._

*System Requirements*

For the ZCS system requirements see System Requirements for {product-name} at the end of this guide.

*Modifying Operating System Configurations*

_*Important:*_ _The operating system that you use should be at the
current patch level before you install ZCS. See the latest release notes
for a list of the operating systems patches that have been tested with
ZCS._

The {product-name} runs on one of several operating systems,
including UbuntuÂ® LTS, Red HatÂ® Enterprise Linux, and SUSEÂ® Linux
Enterprise.

Installation modifications for frequently used operating systems are
described in individual configuration documents found on the ZCS
documentation website, such as __Installation Modifications for ZCS with
Ubuntu LTS__, or __Installation Modifications for ZCS with Red Hat__.
Other operating systems may require similar modifications, and you can
use the information contained in these documents as a reference to gauge
whether your operating system might need to be modified.

A full default installation of the Linux distribution that you select is
required.

*{product-name} Network Edition 8.6 27*

*Multi-Server Installation Guide*

For more information, refer to the System Requirements for {product-name} document for information on hardware and software
configurations supported by {product-name}.

*Configuring High-Fidelity Document Preview*

The high-fidelity document preview feature requires the installation of
LibreOffice or the LibreOffice-headless package, depending on the
operating system you are running.

If the LibreOffice is installed, the system is automatically configured
to use the high-fidelity document preview. If LibreOffice is not
installed, the preview engine from prior {product-name} releases
is used.

This can be accomplished with the Linux package management systems: ï®
For RHEL, install the libreoffice-headless package:

yum install libreoffice +
yum install libreoffice-headless

ï® For SLES, install libreoffice: yast2 -i libreoffice

ï® For Ubuntu, install libreoffice: apt-get install libreoffice

*Install Language and Font Packages*

Confirm you have the appropriate language packs or fonts installed for
LibreOffice to properly view documents and attachments. For example:

*Installing Zimbra Proxy*

Installing the zimbra-proxy package is optional, but recommended for
scalable multi-server deployment. Zimbra proxy is normally installed on
the MTA server or can be configured on a separate server. Zimbra proxy
can be installed on more than one server. At least one instance of
zimbra-memcached must be installed to cache the route information
(upstream mailbox server for each endclient).

_*Important:*_ _If you are moving from a non-proxy environment (for
example, single server to multi-server environment), additional steps
are necessary for the mailbox server and proxy configuration. After you
complete the proxy installation, reconfigure the mailbox server as
described in the ZCS Administration Guide, Zimbra Proxy chapter._

_*Note:*_ _Memcached is shipped as the caching layer to cache LDAP
lookups. Memcache does not have authentication and security features so
the servers should have a firewall set up appropriately. The default
port is 11211 and is controlled by zimbraMemcacheBindPort conf setting
in zimbraserver._

If you are installing zimbra-proxy on the MTA server, select the
zimbra-proxy package and the zimbra-memcached package. Follow the
installation process for Installing Zimbra MTA on a Server on page 48.
After Step 8, configure the Zimbra-proxy.

memcached packages, type *y* and press *Enter* to install the selected
package.

The Main menu displays the default entries for the Zimbra component you
are installing. Select *Proxy Configuration* menu. You can modify any of
the values.

â¢

The *Bind password for Nginx ldap user* is configured when the LDAP
server was installed. This is set when the MTA connected to the LDAP
server. This is not used unless the Kerberos5 authenticating mechanism
is enabled. **Note**: Setting the password even though GSSAPI auth/proxy
is not set up does not cause any issues.

*Installing zimbra-archiving Package*

Installing the zimbra-archiving package is optional. This package
enables Zimbra Archiving and Discovery, which offers:

ï® Archiving, the ability to archive messages that were delivered to or
sent by ZCS

ï® Discovery, the ability to search across mailboxes

The prerequisite to enabling archiving and discovery is the installation
and configuration of the zimbra-archiving package __on at least one
mailbox server__. The installation of this package provides the ZCS
discovery (also known as

*56 Network Edition 8.6 {product-name}*

*Multiple-Server Installation*

cross mailbox) search tool and sets the attributes that allow archiving
to be enabled on the Zimbra MTAs.

To enable archiving and discovery, select the zimbra-store and zimbra-
archiving packages during your installation process. The zimbra-core
package is installed by default.

*Spam/Ham Training on MTA servers*

New installs of ZCS limit spam/ham training to the first MTA installed.
If you uninstall or move this MTA, you will need to enable spam/ham
training on another MTA, as one host should have this enabled to run
**zmtrainsa --cleanup**. To do this, set **zmlocalconfig -e
zmtrainsa_cleanup_host=TRUE**.

*Verifying Server Configuration*

When *Configuration complete - press return to exit* is displayed, the
installation is finished and the server has been started. Before going
to the next server, you should verify that the server is running.

Use the CLI command, **zmcontrol status**, to verify that each server is
running.

1.  
2.  
3.  

_*Note:*_ _If services are not started, you can type_ zmcontrol start__.
See the CLI command appendix in the Administration Guide for more
zmcontrol commands.__

*Logging on to the Administration Console*

1.

ï®

ï®

To log on to the administration console, open your browser, type the
administration console URL and log on to the console. The administration
console URL is entered as:

In case of Mailbox servers containing backend mailstore and UI services
together (mailstore server + UI server), you can access the admin
console directly using *https://<mailstore hostname>:<zimbraAdminPort>*
(default value of zimbraAdminPort is 7071).

In case of a deployment having even a single mailbox server running in
Web Application server split mode, the admin console needs to be
accessed strictly through the proxy using *https://<proxy
hostname>:<zimbraAdminProxyPort>* after switching
zimbraReverseProxyAdminEnabled to TRUE and restarting the proxy (default
value of zimbraAdminProxyPort is 9071).

_*Note:*_

_*Note:*_

_The administration console address must be typed with âhttpsâ, even if
you configured only âhttpâ._

_The first time you log on, a certificate authority (CA) alert may be
displayed. Click_ *Accept this certificate permanently* _to accept the_

*60 Network Edition 8.6*

*{product-name}*

_certificate and be able connect to the Zimbra administration console.
Then click_ _**OK**._

\2. Enter the admin user name and password configured during the
installation process. Enter the user name as **admin@example.com**.

*Post Installation Tasks*

Once the {product-name} is installed, if you installed the Zimbra
license, you can log on to the administration console and configure
additional domains, create Classes of Service, and provision accounts.
See the Zimbra Administratorâs Guide.

*Defining Classes of Service*

A default Class of Service (COS) is automatically created during the
installation of Zimbra software. The COS controls mailbox quotas,
message lifetime, password restrictions, attachment blocking and server
pools. You can modify the default COS and create new COSs to assign to
accounts according to your group management policies.

In an environment with multiple mailbox servers, COS is used to assign
the new accounts to a mailbox server. The COS server pool page lists the
mailbox servers in your Zimbra environment. When you configure the COS,
select which servers to add to the server pool. Within each pool of
servers, a random algorithm assigns new mailboxes to any available
server.

To create or modify a COS, from the administration console, click COS.
If you have questions, refer to the Help.

*Provisioning Accounts*

You can configure one account at a time with the New Account Wizard or
you can create many accounts at once using the Account Migration Wizard.

*Configuring One Account*

The administration console New Account Wizard steps you through the
account information to be completed.

1.

\2. 3.

From the administration console Navigation pane, click **Accounts**.

_*Note:*_ _Four accounts are listed: admin account, two spam training
accounts, and a global Documents account. These accounts do not need any
additional configuration._

default COS and global features. +
To configure aliases, forwarding addresses, and specific features for
this

account, proceed through the dialog before you click **Finish**. +
When the accounts are provisioned, these accounts can immediately start
to

send and receive emails.

*Configuring Many Accounts at Once*

You can provision multiple accounts at once using the Account Migration
tool from the administration console. The wizard guides you through the
steps to import accounts from an external directory server, either
Active Directory or an LDAP server. The wizard downloads account
information from your directory and creates the accounts in ZCS.

Refer to the administration guide to learn more about provisioning
accounts.

*Import the Content of Usersâ Mailboxes*

Zimbraâs migration and import tools can be used to move usersâ email
messages, calendars, and contacts from their old email servers to their
accounts on the Zimbra server. When the userâs files are imported, the
folder hierarchy is maintained. These tools can be accessed from the
administration console Download page and instruction guides are
available from the Administration Console Help Desk.

*Uninstalling {product-name}*

To uninstall servers, you run the install script -u and then delete the
zcs directory and remove the ZCS tgz file on the servers.

*Configuring Multi-Master Replication*

Set up multi-master LDAP replication to have a copy of the LDAP database
saved on each server in a group of LDAP servers identified for
multi-master replication (MMR). The database can be updated by any
member of the group. If one master fails, the other masters continue to
update the database.

The Zimbra install program is used to configure the multi-master LDAP
servers. Each master LDAP server is given an unique identifier when they
are configured and zmlocalconfig is used to add the ldap server to the
multi- master group.

You can also promote an existing replica to be part of the multi-master
group. Topics in this chapter include:

ïµ Managing Multiple Master LDAP Servers on page 69 +
ïµ Enabling Multi-Master Replication on Initial Stand-Alone LDAP Master
on

page 70 +
ïµ Installing a Secondary Master LDAP Server on page 70 +
ïµ Promote Existing Replicas to Multi-Master LDAP Servers on page 72 ïµ
Monitoring Multiple LDAP Master Status on page 73

*Managing Multiple Master LDAP Servers*

When you enable multi-master replication, you assign a server ID to each
master server to identify them in the group. This is used to distinguish
the servers in the group and to help resolve conflicts that might occur.

In addition, each server is configured to assign internal replication
IDâs that are unique to that specific server. Other LDAP master server
can use the same replication ID, but within the server, these
replication IDs must be unique.

You can run the ZCS multiple master CLI, *zmldapquery-mmr* from a
specific master to see the server ID for that master and all
multi-master servers that are in the group and to see the replication ID
values for those masters.

On the server, enter the command as

/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmldapquery-mmr

*{product-name} Network Edition 8.6 69*

*Multi-Server Installation Guide*

*Enabling Multi-Master Replication on Initial Stand-Alone LDAP Master*

Before you can enable the multi-master replication feature, you must
know the hostname of the first secondary master that is being added to
the group. The hostname is entered when you enable the feature. Once you
enable the multi- master replication feature, you do not need to run the
command again.

When zmlocalconfig is run the first time, the master LDAP servers are
configured as follows:

* 
* 
* 
* 

1.  
2.  

*Installing a Secondary Master LDAP Server*

The master LDAP server must be running when you install the secondary
LDAP servers. You run the ZCS install program on the secondary master
LDAP servers to install the LDAP package.

*Passwords Required to Install the Secondary Master*

Before you install a secondary master, you must know the following
passwords:

ï® Zimbra admin LAP password ï® LDAP replication password ï® NGINX LDAP
password +
ï® Amavis LDAP password

ï® Postfix LDAP password +
To find these passwords, on the ZCS server run zmlocalconfig -s | grep
passw | grep ldap

*Promote Existing Replicas to Multi-Master LDAP Servers*

In an existing ZCS setup where there is already a single master and
multiple replicas, you can promote an existing replica to become a
secondary master.

1.  
2.  
3.  
4.  

This updates the replica to be a multi-master replica, enabled with a
server ID. It is automatically configured to be a paired master with the
master it was previously replicating from.

*Deleting a Multi-Master Replication Node*

To delete a multi-master replication (MMR) node, use the following
steps.

_*Note:*_ _Deleting an MMR node can only be performed in ZCS 8.0.7 and
later._

1.

\2. 3.

4.

Update the *ldap_master_url* and *ldap_url* on every node, removing the
LDAP MMR node that will be shut down.

Wait 5-10 minutes to ensure the modification is in place.

Monitor */var/log/zimbra.log* on the MMR node that will be shut down and
confirm it is no longer receiving modification traffic.

Run *ldap stop* on the MMR node that is being shut down.

*Monitoring Multiple LDAP Master Status*

The Monitoring LDAP Replication Status feature monitors the change
sequence number (CSN) values between an LDAP master server and an LDAP
replica server. The replica server is considered a shadow copy of the
master server. If the servers become out of sync, the monitoring feature
indicates the problem. The out of sync time period is typically five
minutes, although this value is configurable.

*Feature Requirement*

Run the script *zmreplchk* located in **/opt/zimbra/libexec. +
**__*Important:*__ _This script must be run on a ZCS server that has a
localconfig_

_value set for_ __*l*__**dap_url** __that includes all of the master
servers. +

*Configuring LDAP Replication Overview*

Setting up LDAP replication lets you distribute Zimbra server queries to
specific replica LDAP servers. Only one master LDAP server can be set
up. This server is authoritative for user information, server
configuration, etc. Replica LDAP servers can be defined to improve
performance and to reduce the load on the master server. All updates are
made to the master server and these updates are copied to the replica
servers.

The Zimbra install program is used to configure a master LDAP server and
additional read-only replica LDAP servers. The master LDAP server is
installed and configured first, following the normal ZCS installation
options. The LDAP replica server installation is modified to point the
replica server to the LDAP master host.

When the master LDAP server and the replica LDAP servers are correctly
installed, the following is automatically configured:

*Multi-Server Installation Guide*

*Installing Zimbra Master LDAP Server*

You must install the master LDAP server before you can install replica
LDAP servers. Refer to Installing Zimbra LDAP Master Server on page 37
for master LDAP server installation instructions. After the installation
of the master LDAP server has completed continue to the section titled
'Enabling Replication on the LDAP Master.

*Enable Replication on the LDAP Master*

On the master LDAP server, as a Zimbra user, type: */opt/zimbra/libexec/
zmldapenablereplica* and press **Enter**. This enables replication on
the LDAP Master.

*Installing a Replica LDAP Server*

The master LDAP server must be running when you install the replica
server. You run the ZCS install program on the replica server to install
the LDAP package.

Follow steps 1 through 4 in Starting the Installation Process on page 32
to open a SSH session to the LDAP server, log on to the server as root,
and unpack the Zimbra software.

1.

The installation on the replica LDAP server is complete. The content of
the master LDAP directory is copied to the replica LDAP server.

*Test the Replica*

1.

Create several user accounts, either from the admin console or on the
master LDAP server. The CLI command to create these accounts is

zmprov ca <name@domain.com> <password>

If you do not have a mailbox server setup, you can create domains
instead. Use this CLI command to create a domain

zmprov cd <domain name>

*78 Network Edition 8.6*

*{product-name}*

*Configuring LDAP Replication*

\2. To see if the accounts were correctly copied to the replica LDAP
server, on the replica LDAP server, type zmprov -l gaa. Type zmprov gad
to check all domains.

The accounts/domains created on the master LDAP server should display on
the replica LDAP server.

In cases where the mailbox server is not setup, you can also use the
following command for account creation.

zmprov ca <name@domain> <password> zimbraMailTransport
<where_to_deliver>

*Configuring Zimbra Servers to Use LDAP Replica*

To use the replica LDAP server instead of the master LDAP server, you
must update the ldap_url value on the Zimbra servers that will query the
replica instead of the master. For each server that you want to change:

1.  
2.  
3.  

*Additional Steps for MTA hosts.* After updating the ldap_url, rerun
**/opt/zimbra/ libexec/zmmtainit**.

This rewrites the Postfix configuration with the updated ldap_url.

*Uninstalling an LDAP Replica Server*

If you do not want to use an LDAP replica server, follow these steps to
disable it.

_*Note:*_ _Uninstalling an LDAP server is the same as disabling it on
the master LDAP server._

*Remove LDAP Replica from All Active Servers*

\1. On each member server, including the replica, verify the *ldap_url*
value. Type zmlocalconfig [ldap_url]

*{product-name}*

*Network Edition 8.6 79*

*Multi-Server Installation Guide*

\2. Remove the disabled LDAP replica server URL from zmlocalconfig. Do
this by modifying the *ldap_url* to only include enabled ZCS LDAP
servers. The master LDAP server should always be at the end of the
*ldap_url* string value.

*Disable LDAP on the Replica*

To disable LDAP on the replica server,

1.  
2.  

[source,western]
----
           zmprov -l ms <zmhostname> -zimbraServiceEnabled ldap
----

\3. Type *zmcontrol start* to start other current Zimbra services on the
server.

*Additional steps for MTA host.* After updating the *ldap_url* with
**zmlocalconfig**, rerun **/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmmtainit**. This
rewrites the Postfix configuration with the updated **ldap_url**.

*Monitoring LDAP Replication Status*

The Monitoring LDAP Replication Status feature monitors the change
sequence number (CSN) values between an LDAP master server and an LDAP
replica server. The replica server is considered a shadow copy of the
master server. If the servers become out of sync, the monitoring feature
indicates the problem. The out of sync time period is typically five
minutes, although this value is configurable.

*Feature Requirement*

Run the script *zmreplchk* located in */opt/zimbra/libexec.*

_*Important:*_ _This script must be run on a ZCS server that has a
localconfig value set for_ __*l*__**dap_url** _that includes all of the
replica servers and ends with the master server._

*Error Codes and Status Explanations*

The following monitoring error codes and status explanations are given
with this feature:
